# Face-Recognition
Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level
understanding from digital images or videos. It is the most widely used field of artificial intelligence (AI)
that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other
visual inputs. Different types of computer vision include image segmentation, object detection, facial recognition, edge detection, pattern detection, image classification, and feature matching.
The system is made using following steps and libraries:
the AdaBoost learning algorithm, Haar cascade classifier, openCV methods. The first approach towards
developing a system that detects and recognizes face is face detection and creating a dataset of the face of
20 subjects from which the model learns and is used for recognition. Moving on to the next phase which is
recognition of the faces from the real-time input video, for that LBPHrecognizer is used and the name of
the respective person is displayed else unknown is displayed. By using these methods our system is capable
of recognizing 70 percent of the faces correctly.
